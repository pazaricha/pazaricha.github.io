Shitty days.

We all have them, and they know exactly where to hit you.
For me it usually happens after I've had a totally awesome run for a few weeks maybe months.
You get up in the morning like any other day and for some reason - nothing seems to work.

You turn on your laptop, hoping to get some work done and before you know it's 1 PM and you didn't accomplish anything today. Notice I've used the word accomplish and not "make" or "do" since this things doesn't count to me, when i'm talking about accomplishing things I mean actual real things that you can check off from you to do list.

I've made quick list of things that help me deal with this type of days, and if I follow it - It won't feel like a wasted day to me.

## 1. Watch a Lecture From Someone You Admire
We all have people that we admire and that gives us the inspiration to pursue our dreams and live life to their full extent. For me it's people like [Steve Jobs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) or [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://vimeo.com/3899696).

After hearing these guys speak, I'm feel like I've been fueled with energy that gets my mind and mostly my soul in go getter state.

## 2. Learn at Least 1 New Thing That Will Improve Your Craft
Learning new stuff used to be hard. You'd have to go libraries and read actual physical books or even take classes in order to learn new things. Today, There is simply no excuse not to learn something new that will make you a better developer or designer.

For example, if you're a designer and you've never actually "Developed" anything, even coded you own designs in to living working HTML and CSS pages. This type of days are great for learning new stuff just like these.

It will boost your confidence and of course will extend your current skill set. Same thing goes for developers, Photoshop isn't that hard as you think it is.

## 3. Have a Pet/Fun/Personal Project to Work On
Having your own personal project that has absolutely no limitations (except the ones you make of course) is one of the best medications for this kind of days. It frees your mind from clients limitations and let you adopt whatever new technologies or techniques you want, and most of all - **It will never feel like a chore for you**.

Personally, for me it's <a title="Personal finance management tool" href="http://keeptrack.in" target="_blank">Keeptrack.in</a> (yeah, it's a bad name, I know and I'm working on it) and I'm having a blast working on it without having a client that tells me what do to and how things should work.
It just feels good to call your own shots and scratching your own itch.
